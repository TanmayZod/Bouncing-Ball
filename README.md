# Bouncing-Ball
A bouncing ball Java program typically simulates the motion of a ball bouncing within a confined area, such as a window or a canvas. Here's a description of how such a program might work:

Initialization: The program initializes variables such as the initial position, velocity, size, and color of the ball. It also sets up the graphical user interface (GUI) where the ball will be displayed.

Animation Loop: The core of the program is an animation loop that continuously updates the position of the ball and redraws it on the screen. This loop runs indefinitely until the program is closed.

Physics Simulation: Inside the animation loop, the program calculates the new position of the ball based on its current velocity and direction. It also checks for collisions with the boundaries of the confined area (e.g., walls) and updates the velocity accordingly to simulate the bouncing motion.

Rendering: After calculating the new position of the ball, the program redraws it on the screen at the updated location. This gives the illusion of motion as the ball appears to move and bounce within the confined area.

User Interaction: Optionally, the program may allow user interaction, such as adjusting the properties of the ball (e.g., size, color) or pausing/resuming the animation.

Overall, a bouncing ball Java program provides a fun and educational way to learn about graphical programming, animation, and basic physics principles such as motion and collisions. It's often used as a beginner-friendly project for learning Java programming and graphical user interface (GUI) development.
